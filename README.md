With Java 8 Streams API, it's easy to iterate over collections and to parallise a stream is as easy as by calling a parallelStream() method. But, should we using parallelStream() wherever we can? What are the considerations?

Performance Matrix of Reactive APIs With WebFulx and Redis
Reactive Systems are designed to address challenges posed by modern software systems - the challenges related to a large number of users and high throughput. Reactive systems are expected to be highly responsive, resilient, elastic and message-driven.

In this article we will:

1. Build a set of fully non-blocking REST API using SpringBoot 2.0, WebFlux and Reactive Redis.
1. Performance test the above Reactive APIs against the traditional non-reactive APIs
